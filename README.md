# MSc Cybersecurity Engineering Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for my MSc Cybersecurity Engineering Project. The project focuses on exploring how gamification can be integrated into cybersecurity education to enhance user engagement, improve learning outcomes, and promote secure online behaviors. It investigates the use of dynamic, interactive game-like elements to create a more engaging and effective learning experience, particularly in raising awareness of social engineering threats.
